# BITSA Tutorial Example

Simple exercise to highlight branching and merging strategies. 

Goal:
Our goal is to promote the most recent changes to the services, and deploy them to production! 
Sadly, your teammate is on holiday and they didn't get the chance to tell what the most recent branch is. 
Figure out the most recent version and get the versions into master. 

Versioning:
- 1.65 > 1.55
- 2.80 > 1.80

Hints:
You can speak to one another.

Current branches:
- BITSA_branch_1
- BITSA_branch_2
- BITSA_branch_3
- BITSA_branch_4
- BITSA_branch_5

Useful github commands:
- RENAME:
- DELETE BRANCH:
- CREATE BRANCH:
