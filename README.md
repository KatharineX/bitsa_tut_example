# BITSA Tutorial Example

Simple exercise to highlight branching and merging strategies. 

Goal:
Our goal is to promote the most recent changes to the services, and deploy them to production! 
Sadly, your teammate is on holiday and they didn't get the chance to tell what the most recent branch is. 
Figure out the most recent version and get the versions into master. 

Versioning:
- 1.65 is more recent than 1.55
- 2.80 is more recent than 1.80

Hints:
You can speak to one another.

Current branches:
- BITSA_branch_1
- BITSA_branch_2
- BITSA_branch_3
- BITSA_branch_4
- BITSA_branch_5
